* **Agnosticism:** With _Radiaction_, developers don't need to know _how_/_where_/_when_ their distributed functions will be running.

* **Modularity:** Encapsulated modules containing actions and reactions next to each other allow developers to keep coding with the mindset of a non distributed application.

* **Separation of concerns:** DevOps don't need to interfere on how developers are writting their functions. Scaling and even changing the infrasctructure can be done independently by DevOps with no change in the application code.

> **WARNING!** This is an experimental project. It's use is not yet recommended for production.
