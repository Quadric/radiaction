# Radiaction

_Radiaction_ is a nodejs library for building seamless distributed applications.

* **Agnosticism:** With _Radiaction_, developers don't need to know _how_/_where_/_when_ their distributed functions will be running.

* **Modularity:** Encapsulated modules containing actions and reactions next to each other allow developers to keep coding with the mindset of a non distributed application.

* **Separation of concerns:** DevOps don't need to interfere on how developers are writting their functions. Scaling and even changing the infrasctructure can be done independently by DevOps with no change in the application code.

_Radiaction_ makes it painless for Developers to write distributed apps and for DevOps to keep everything running.
